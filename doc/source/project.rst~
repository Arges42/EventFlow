Project Summary
===============

Short summary of the features and some example visualizations.

Features
--------

**Feature 1** - High-level api

The event graphs are summarizied in a compact class, which offer basic manipulation api, 
without worrying about the exact event triples.

**Feature 2** - Visualization

The event graphs are computed for a single actor and these can then be visualized in the event explorer app.

**Feature 3** - Drawing api

The drawing api can be used without the app, making it accesible to everybody who just wants to have a quick peek at the data.

**Feature 4** - Exemplary setup of the event graph database

Examples
--------

The event explorer can be used to visualize the activities of actors, 
either standalone or in combination with other actors. The following snapshots show some
sample usages. Figure 1 highlights the journeys of Christoper Columbus. While figure 2 and 3 show 
the activities of Angela Merkel and Barack Obama in the year 2015. Merkel traveled mostly in Europe while
Obama was mentioned almost all over the world.

The following two screenshots show the complete interface of the app. Active actors are shown on the left side, while 
the right side gives extra informations about the location (who was mentioned when at that location).
Unfortunately the zoom in on Shima does not show the G7-meeting which took place between the 26.05.2016 and 27.05.2016.
